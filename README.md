Project Title :
# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

# # Description

At some point in our journey to become a full-stack web developer, weâ€™ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment&mdash;perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help familiarize us with these tests and allow us to use the skills covered in this module, this Challenge invites us to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that we write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.
